    "The research group led by UBC computer science professor Frank Wood set up a Minecraft server to collect data to learn more about people's video game behaviours. Demographics such as age, gender, and experience as well as the number of hours played on the server were tracked. A major challenge in running this project is ensuring how the team should target recruitment efforts. Therefore, this data analysis was done as an exploration in part with Dr. Wood's team. Our analysis will focus on one of the major issues related to targeting recruitment efforts, which is focusing on certain behaviours or characteristics in predicting subscription to a newsletter. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aimed to respond to this issue by exploring the question: \n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Can age, experience, and player hours predict whether or not a player will subscribe to the newsletter?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "We attempted to answer this question by employing a predictive K-NN classfication model. Data from the \"players.csv\" dataset was used as it included the relevant predictor and response variables. This dataset includes 196 observations and 7 variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable information for the \"players.csv\" dataset:\n",
    "1. `experience` (**character**):\n",
    "    - player's experience playing Minecraft\n",
    "2. `subscribe` (**logical**):\n",
    "    - player's subscription status\n",
    "3. `hashedEmail` (**character**):\n",
    "    - player's hashed email\n",
    "4. `played_hours` (**numeric (double)**):\n",
    "    - player's total played hours on the server\n",
    "5. `name` (**character**):\n",
    "    - player's name\n",
    "6. `gender` (**character**):\n",
    "    - player's gender\n",
    "7. `Age` (**numeric (double)**):\n",

    "The data analysis will consist of setting up and evaluating a KNN classification model with three quantitative variables as predictors and a factor as a response variable. We will choose an optimal k-value by tuning the model. With this k-value, we will test the revised model against the testing data to evaluate its accuracy and metrics. Finally, we will feed the model new observations to predict and evaluate the model's performance on new unseen data.\n",

    "Specifically:\n",
    "1) create recipe and model specification for training data\n",
    "    - tuning specification by setting neighbour = tune()\n",
    "    - standardize data so all predictors have equal contributions\n",
    "2) create a 5-fold cross validation to test values of k from 1 to 20 to choose the optimal value of k\n",
    "3) create a workflow to combine the recipe, tuning specification, and information of cross-validation.\n",
    "    - collect the accuracy of this workflow and show its results as a visualization and tibble"
